# API-NASA

### Unfortunately the Mars rover that was responsible for the data that powered this API is no longer reporting temperatures and wind speed. Currently the only info we get back is pressure, and wind direction and some days provide no data at all. 

### For now, I've stopped updating the code and have removed this project from my portfolio. It was one of my first attempts at fetching data from an external API and using DOM maniuplation.
